- 👋 Hi, I’m @JUNIORprogramme
- 👀 I’m interested in developing websites and simple games, and reaching out to new programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work on larger projects by next year, and also make aquaintances with more programmers.
- 📫 You can reach me on my e-mail, juniorprogramme27@gmail.com.
